Nowadays, the role of `Data Analysts` become popular and critical in firms when the world turns digitalized. Vietnam is not exceptional, enterprises need colleagues who utilize complicated data to help end-users make better decisions.

Being a data analyst, I spend 70% of my time on `Analysis`, and 30% left on `Reporting`. 
Firstly, `Reporting` appears when the end users require me to create reports to describe what they expect to see. The given information is supervised, and known in advance. For example, `the growth of sales within the two latest years`, `the change of employee performance after the layoff`...
Secondly, I do `Analysis` when what I receive from end users are questions. Simplistically, they show me the problems and ask me to help find the reasons or solutions based on data. For example, `the board of directors suggests opening new stores in the new place, where as particular as possible in that place should we choose to open new stores?`, `the marketing team ran the promotion campaign last month, do promotional products cannibalize non-promotional ones?`...Moreover, I read several scholarly journals to promote new possible ideas to my direct managers without requirements.

The above analysis projects are a primary part of my `Analysis`. 
To prevent information leakage, I used the public sample dataset instead.
To execute each project, the Python scripts might be referred from scholarly journal's authors, and adjusted to fit with my `Analysis` context.
