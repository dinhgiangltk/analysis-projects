In today's digitalized world, the role of Data Analysts has gained significant popularity and has become crucial for businesses. Vietnam is no exception, as enterprises require skilled professionals who can effectively utilize complex data to assist end-users in making informed decisions.

As a data analyst with extensive experience, I allocate approximately 70% of my time to conducting thorough analysis, while the remaining 30% is dedicated to reporting. During the reporting phase, I create comprehensive reports based on end-users' specific requirements. These reports encompass supervised and predefined information, such as the growth of sales over the past two years or the impact of employee layoffs on performance.

In contrast, the analysis phase involves addressing inquiries posed by end-users. They present me with specific problems and rely on my expertise to uncover underlying reasons or provide data-driven solutions. For instance, I may be asked to determine the most suitable location for new store openings, considering precise geographical factors. Additionally, I proactively explore scholarly journals to discover new ideas and insights, which I then share with my direct managers, even in the absence of specific requests.

The aforementioned analysis projects constitute a significant portion of my overall responsibilities. To ensure confidentiality and prevent information leakage, I utilize public sample datasets instead of actual data. In executing each project, I refer to Python scripts developed by authors of scholarly journals, making necessary adjustments to align with the context of my analyses.
